# Hyperapp + ParcelJS with Typescript

Impressive alternative to Webpack + React + Redux + Redux-obserbable/thunks/sagas + Typescript

* Hot module replacement, including state and actions hot replacement.
* Typescript
* JSX
* Much more simple architecture than React + Redux + Webpack thanks to HyperApp and ParcelJS!
* Interoperability: The app function returns a copy of your actions where every function is wired to changes in the state. Exposing this object to the outside world can be useful to operate your application from another program or framework, subscribe to global events, listen to mouse and keyboard input, etc.
